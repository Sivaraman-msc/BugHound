## Quick Start

Run these commands to quickly set up and start the project:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd BugHound 

# Install backend dependencies

>**Note:** Weâ€™ve removed strict mode because of CKEditor, so you need to use `--force` when installing.

cd BugHound
npm install --force 

# Seed the database with initial data
npm run seed

# Start the backend server
npm start

# Open a new terminal, install frontend dependencies
cd Bug_Hound_UI
npm install

# Start the frontend development server
npm run dev
